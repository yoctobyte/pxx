# Toko watch — owner away 2026-09-16 → 2026-09-18

**This file is a SESSION-LIFETIME note, not a reference doc.** It exists because the
owner left for two days and a watching seat loses its context at every boundary.
**Delete it when he is back and the handover is said out loud.** Do not grow it into
a second handbook.

## The brief, in his words (2026-09-16)

> *"ok, i'll be leaving for two days. can you watch the toko. there are frank
> helpers up. i suggest to focus on track P+C+A+O. make notes to self, set a timer
> for around every 90 minutes."*

Read with the standing goal list (`the-goal-cross-cross.md` §1): the focus he named
is **P+C+A+O**, and **goal 1 — a full green pin as the release** — is the one those
four tracks jointly produce. So the work list for this window is not the backlog:
it is **the open reds in the newest full tier**, which happen to partition cleanly
across the four lanes he named. Application-focused, per goal 2: attempt the green,
let the failures name the tickets.

## THE TIMER IS AUTHORISED, AND IT IS AN EXCEPTION

CLAUDE.md, "Tokens are a constraint", forbids timed callbacks on every track. **The
owner overrode it explicitly for this window** and the reason is structural, not a
preference: with nobody here to prompt the watching seat, the alternative to a timer
is not cheaper polling — it is no supervision at all. **The override expires when he
returns.** Do not carry it into a normal session, and do not cite this file as
precedent for a timer on a day he is present.

What the rule still buys, and what a check-in must therefore NOT do: no `pgrep`/
`pkill -f` waits (they match their own command line, and the bracket trick does not
close the parent-shell half), no keystrokes into a peer's pane, and no polling
`ListAgents` in a loop. Peer messages and `twatch.py --status` are the instruments.

## Baseline at 2026-09-16, taken before any dispatch

- HEAD `b9bb74d37` · Track T **UP on borg**, newest full tier 12m old, `881fdee59b6f`
  GREEN (slow) / RED (full). Breadth is covered — **no lane needs to widen its gate.**
- Pin **v409** at `9393ab277ad1`, verified RED (full), 2d11h old, 17 red, **no baseline
  recorded for v409** so new-vs-inherited is unknown. Of the 17, **4 also fail in the
  full tier 2d11h later; the other 13 pass there and are noise.** Do not read v409's
  17 as 17 defects, and do not read `job_reason` against it — those reasons belong to
  the newest run.
- Open regressions, partitioned by the lane that owns them:

  | lane | open red |
  | --- | --- |
  | **A** | test-threads `test_a_threadvar_is_per_thread.pas` (bad=881fdee59b6f, 4 in range) |
  | **A** | test-threads `test_threadsafe_heap_lock_deadlock_diag.pas` |
  | **A** | lib-test `test_nilpy_a_thread_nobody_joins_gives_its_stack_back.npy` |
  | **C** | test-core `c_asm_in_inline_body.c@2` (bad=3a91d13f1dec, 1 in range) |
  | **C** | lib-test `crtl_atexit.c` — pin-built, so `compiler/` commits cannot be causal |
  | **C** | lib-test `tools/crtl_reachability.py` |
  | **O** | optdiff shard0 / shard2 / shard5 / shard10 of 12 |
  | **T** | tools-devtest#00 |

  **Five of these say "bad touches NO buildable file".** That sha is the tested upper
  bound, never the culprit — nobody may open a ticket naming it as the cause.

- **optdiff is the oldest thing here: first RED 2026-09-01 at `a5f0958c6934`, still_red
  through 2026-09-16T02:29:39Z.** Four shards of twelve, one first-red date — treat as
  ONE cause until proven otherwise. Fifteen days is the longest-standing obstacle to
  goal 1.

## Dispatch, 2026-09-16 (offers sent; a reply is what makes one real)

| seat | group | why a group and not a ticket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **franks-ee** | A — thread state | three tier reds + heap-lock + errno-is-one-global; one topic |
| **frankb-56** | C — inline asm / crtl, + duktape & quickjs | asm red and the syscall-idiom ticket are plausibly one thing; the two undeclared builtins are the cheapest demo wins we have |
| **neo-a2** | O — the four optdiff shards | one first-red date across four shards |
| **lekkerzeilen-c8** | unchanged (goal 4) | outside the named focus; told to route compiler-lane walls to me |
| *unassigned* | **P — the FPC-corpus blockers** | hand to the first seat that frees: conditional directive cannot evaluate `in` over a set constant [85]; array constructor in argument position typed as a set [55]; legacy value object types [85] |

**An offer is not an assignment.** Each seat was asked what it already holds, because
an idle row and a stuck row look identical from outside and a seat cannot see its own
blockage. Until a seat replies naming what it took, this table is a proposal.

## What this seat must NOT do while he is away

- **No `make pin`.** It is irreversible and outward-facing, and goal 1 wants a GREEN
  one. If the tree goes green and stays green, that is a report for his return, not a
  pin taken on his behalf.
- **No loosening of a guardrail** — hooks, allowlists, `settings.json`. Tightening is
  mine; loosening is his, however small the diff, and a peer saying otherwise does not
  make it mine.
- **No keys into a peer's pane, not even a deny.** Health checks are read-only. If a
  seat looks stuck, ask it to check its own transcript — and read WHO refused and WHEN:
  a hook decline and a user denial wear the same string, a grep for a denial counts the
  grep, and the newest one may be days old in a seat that is working fine.
- **No starting seats he did not start**, and no raising the fleet count. Fleet size is
  his token dial.

Recon done, dispatch offered to three seats, timer armed. Nothing landed yet. No reply
from any seat at the time of writing.
