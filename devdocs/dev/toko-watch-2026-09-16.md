# Toko watch — owner away 2026-09-16 → 2026-09-18

**This file is a SESSION-LIFETIME note, not a reference doc.** It exists because the
owner left for two days and a watching seat loses its context at every boundary.
**Delete it when he is back and the handover is said out loud.** Do not grow it into
a second handbook.

## The brief, in his words (2026-09-16)

> *"ok, i'll be leaving for two days. can you watch the toko. there are frank
> helpers up. i suggest to focus on track P+C+A+O. make notes to self, set a timer
> for around every 90 minutes."*

Read with the standing goal list (`the-goal-cross-cross.md` §1): the focus he named
is **P+C+A+O**, and **goal 1 — a full green pin as the release** — is the one those
four tracks jointly produce. So the work list for this window is not the backlog:
it is **the open reds in the newest full tier**, which happen to partition cleanly
across the four lanes he named. Application-focused, per goal 2: attempt the green,
let the failures name the tickets.

## THE TIMER IS AUTHORISED, AND IT IS AN EXCEPTION

CLAUDE.md, "Tokens are a constraint", forbids timed callbacks on every track. **The
owner overrode it explicitly for this window** and the reason is structural, not a
preference: with nobody here to prompt the watching seat, the alternative to a timer
is not cheaper polling — it is no supervision at all. **The override expires when he
returns.** Do not carry it into a normal session, and do not cite this file as
precedent for a timer on a day he is present.

What the rule still buys, and what a check-in must therefore NOT do: no `pgrep`/
`pkill -f` waits (they match their own command line, and the bracket trick does not
close the parent-shell half), no keystrokes into a peer's pane, and no polling
`ListAgents` in a loop. Peer messages and `twatch.py --status` are the instruments.

## Baseline at 2026-09-16, taken before any dispatch

- HEAD `b9bb74d37` · Track T **UP on borg**, newest full tier 12m old, `881fdee59b6f`
  GREEN (slow) / RED (full). Breadth is covered — **no lane needs to widen its gate.**
- Pin **v409** at `9393ab277ad1`, verified RED (full), 2d11h old, 17 red, **no baseline
  recorded for v409** so new-vs-inherited is unknown. Of the 17, **4 also fail in the
  full tier 2d11h later; the other 13 pass there and are noise.** Do not read v409's
  17 as 17 defects, and do not read `job_reason` against it — those reasons belong to
  the newest run.
- Open regressions, partitioned by the lane that owns them:

  | lane | open red |
  | --- | --- |
  | **A** | test-threads `test_a_threadvar_is_per_thread.pas` (bad=881fdee59b6f, 4 in range) |
  | **A** | test-threads `test_threadsafe_heap_lock_deadlock_diag.pas` |
  | **A** | lib-test `test_nilpy_a_thread_nobody_joins_gives_its_stack_back.npy` |
  | **C** | test-core `c_asm_in_inline_body.c@2` (bad=3a91d13f1dec, 1 in range) |
  | **C** | lib-test `crtl_atexit.c` — pin-built, so `compiler/` commits cannot be causal |
  | **C** | lib-test `tools/crtl_reachability.py` |
  | **O** | optdiff shard0 / shard2 / shard5 / shard10 of 12 |
  | **T** | tools-devtest#00 |

  **Five of these say "bad touches NO buildable file".** That sha is the tested upper
  bound, never the culprit — nobody may open a ticket naming it as the cause.

- **optdiff is the oldest thing here: first RED 2026-09-01 at `a5f0958c6934`, still_red
  through 2026-09-16T02:29:39Z.** Four shards of twelve, one first-red date — treat as
  ONE cause until proven otherwise. Fifteen days is the longest-standing obstacle to
  goal 1.

## Dispatch, 2026-09-16 (offers sent; a reply is what makes one real)

| seat | group | why a group and not a ticket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **franks-ee** | A — thread state | three tier reds + heap-lock + errno-is-one-global; one topic |
| **frankb-56** | C — inline asm / crtl, + duktape & quickjs | asm red and the syscall-idiom ticket are plausibly one thing; the two undeclared builtins are the cheapest demo wins we have |
| **neo-a2** | O — the four optdiff shards | one first-red date across four shards |
| **lekkerzeilen-c8** | unchanged (goal 4) | outside the named focus; told to route compiler-lane walls to me |
| *unassigned* | **P — the FPC-corpus blockers** | hand to the first seat that frees: conditional directive cannot evaluate `in` over a set constant [85]; array constructor in argument position typed as a set [55]; legacy value object types [85] |

**An offer is not an assignment.** Each seat was asked what it already holds, because
an idle row and a stuck row look identical from outside and a seat cannot see its own
blockage. Until a seat replies naming what it took, this table is a proposal.

## What this seat must NOT do while he is away

- **No `make pin`.** It is irreversible and outward-facing, and goal 1 wants a GREEN
  one. If the tree goes green and stays green, that is a report for his return, not a
  pin taken on his behalf.
- **No loosening of a guardrail** — hooks, allowlists, `settings.json`. Tightening is
  mine; loosening is his, however small the diff, and a peer saying otherwise does not
  make it mine.
- **No keys into a peer's pane, not even a deny.** Health checks are read-only. If a
  seat looks stuck, ask it to check its own transcript — and read WHO refused and WHEN:
  a hook decline and a user denial wear the same string, a grep for a denial counts the
  grep, and the newest one may be days old in a seat that is working fine.
- **No starting seats he did not start**, and no raising the fleet count. Fleet size is
  his token dial.

## Check-in log — append one block per ~90 min, newest last

### 2026-09-16, check-in 0 (baseline + first working block)

**Timer armed:** cron job `001e8b7f`, every 2h at :23. He asked for ~90 min; cron cannot
express 1.5h and he chose to round to 2h, session-only (a cloud schedule would wake with
no access to this machine, these peers or this tree). **Session-only means it dies with
this session** — if this seat is restarted, the next one must re-arm it from this note.

**The dispatch table above is now partly WRONG. Corrections, all from the seats
themselves, and each one worth more than the assignment it replaced:**

- **neo-a2 is not a frank.** It is the owner's own home session on the lokaalnieuws
  local-LLM investigation, with live production threads. Declined Track O correctly.
  Do not offer it compiler work.
- **lekkerzeilen-c8 is parked and RIGHT to be.** Its user told it to wrap up; my say-so
  is not its user's approval and it declined to treat it as such. It has since written
  `devdocs/perf/maps/README.md` indexing all ten archived compilers from their `.prov`
  files, and declined to COMMIT it — correctly, since `devdocs/perf/` is untracked in
  its entirety and committing the maps means ~1.4 MB of build artefacts. **That choice
  is the owner's.** Residual risk stated plainly by that seat: a `git clean` takes all
  of it, and the index makes the loss legible without preventing it.
- **`c_asm_in_inline_body.c@2` is NOT Track C.** I grouped it with the syscall-idiom
  ticket on the word `asm` and nothing else. frankb-56 read the test's header, which
  names its own root cause: the inliner's generic cloners (`CloneToInlineRegion`,
  `IRCloneInlineBody`) recursing into ASTLeft/ASTRight on kinds that overload those
  slots as payload. Fires at -O3. **Track A/O.** Its `bad=3a91d13f1dec` is a NilPy
  commit named by POSITION (1-in-range), not a demonstrated cause — reproduce at HEAD
  and at `3a91d13f1^` before believing it.

**THE HOST IS CLEAN — contention and disk are EXCLUDED.** I recorded the expectation
before asking and it held. borg: 66% by bytes, **5% by inodes** (2.7M of 61.9M used),
`/tmp` is ext4 on the same `/dev/sda3` as `/` and `/home`, so bytes-bound not
inode-bound — nothing like the 2026-09-07 shape. Load ~12 is Track T's own 16-job cap
on 8 cores. **The mechanism that settles it is better than the measurement:** all four
optdiff rows are OPT DIFFs with MATCHING exit codes on both sides, and a starved box
cannot make -O0 and -O3 disagree on stdout while agreeing on rc.

**optdiff is not one cause, and the shard stability has a boring explanation.** The
sharder is deterministic, so a fixed set of offending files lands in a fixed set of
shards every run — that is why it is always these four, and it is NOT evidence of a
shared cause. The actual rows:
  shard0  `test_double_to_integer_lvalue_rounds.pas` (rc 0/0)   — unassigned, P or A/O
  shard2  `c_crtl_glob_no_leak.c` (rc 2/2)   \_ glob at -O3, ONE candidate, Track C
  shard10 `c_crtl_glob.c` (rc 2/2)           /     offered to frankb-56
  shard5  `test_c_gtk3_stock.pas` (rc 1/1)            — unassigned
**Date caution:** borg's `open_regressions` all say 2026-09-11T21:50Z with an empty
`good`, but that is the plexus→borg handover, NOT first occurrence. The 2026-09-01
figure comes from `--job-history`, which aggregates hosts. Do not quote borg's
timestamps as first-seen.

**LANDED BY THIS SEAT — `64de90285`.** `gate.sh quick` was RED for the whole shop on
three rows, from `b9bb74d37`, **the owner's own last commit before leaving**, so nobody
was going to claim it. Two seats saw it and both correctly refused to sweep it.
  - `fpc seed compiles (forward decls)` + `FPC seed canary` — the postfix-chain param
    typer calls `PyIsSiteIntTk`, `PyHeaderHasParam`, `PyHeaderParamType` ~30000 lines
    above their definitions. pxx resolves across the unit, FPC resolves in source
    order, **so the tree self-hosts cleanly and the FPC bootstrap seed does not build.**
    This class passes `make compiler/pascal26` AND the quick tier; only the canary sees
    it. **The lint reports ONE site per run** — fixing the first surfaced two more in
    the same block. Three forwards, not one.
  - `AST slot-write census` — updated after READING the diff, not swept. All three rows
    are `AN_BINOP Left <node>`: `lhsN` is a node index assigned from `PyVariantFieldArm`
    and written to `ASTLeft[binN]`, `PyMakeDynAttrGet` returns a node. No new kind parks
    a non-node, so this is the paperwork case. frankb-56 was right to decline it as
    another lane's rows, and right that the forward-decl row was NOT paperwork.

**Seat movement:**
  - **franks-ee (A/thread-state):** two of three tier reds fixed and pushed, and they
    had nothing in common. `554b4947c` — `test_a_threadvar_is_per_thread` was a BAD
    TEST asserting a deliberate race actually manifested, a property of the scheduler;
    the 30/30 green on 12 cores is also what ACQUITS `RewriteThreadVarRefs`. `53833e88e`
    — a real compiler bug: the reentrant owner+depth layer granted the heap lock to
    signal handlers, which run on the interrupted thread and present its tid, so the
    allocator was re-entered half-updated and HUNG (exit 124 is `timeout`'s code, not a
    diagnosis). Fixed statelessly via SA_ONSTACK/sigaltstack bounds. **Residual, open
    and stated:** only the installing thread registers a sigaltstack, so a handler on a
    `clone(2)` thread is still granted. Now on red #3, the leak row.
  - **frankb-56 (C):** `ca92ef81b` `__builtin_inf` → **`make test-duktape` PASS,
    byte-exact, first verdict on any host.** `052eb5e6a` `malloc_usable_size`,
    exact — `PXXAlloc` rounds to 8 and `PXXFree` already recovered the true size from
    the block header, so the honest answer was retrievable all along. **The quickjs
    ticket's "this is the ONLY thing standing between test-quickjs and a verdict" was
    stated twice and is FALSE** — a first-failure reading; `__builtin_frame_address`
    at `quickjs.c:1723` is next, and a census says it is the LAST one. Assigned to
    frankb-56 as a parser-level reduction. **Standing caveat it earned: do not rank the
    remaining C corpus tickets on their own "only thing" claims — two were written by
    the same seat on the same day from the same instrument, one true, one false.**

**STILL OPEN AND UNASSIGNED** (no free seat; offer these first):
  - **All of Track P.** Nobody took it. Top three: conditional directive cannot
    evaluate `in` over a set constant [85]; legacy value object types [85]; array
    constructor in argument position typed as a set [55].
  - optdiff shard0 (`test_double_to_integer_lvalue_rounds.pas`) and shard5
    (`test_c_gtk3_stock.pas`).
  - `c_asm_in_inline_body.c@2` / the generic-AST-walker cloner bug (A or O).
  - **Two NEW NilPy reds from `b9bb74d37`**, surfaced at `ec4b9c6a1f22` — which is this
    seat's own DOCS-ONLY watch-note commit, so it is a tested upper bound and cannot be
    causal: `test_nilpy_bare_return_subscript_slice.npy`,
    `test_nilpy_variant_str_index.npy`. Track N, outside the named focus, unowned.
  - The residual `test_nilpy_a_thread_nobody_joins_gives_its_stack_back` sits with
    franks-ee; a LEAK cannot fail a value assertion, so `tools/assert_no_leak.sh` is
    the instrument.

**Track T's pin_shadow at `67f0878f2e59` (28 reds, 19 unexpected) is a STALE SNAPSHOT,
not a live cluster** — fifteen of the seventeen NilPy rows are recorded FIXED and
closed in borg's own tstate commits (`1e955c708`, `68c71af13`, `93c866526`,
`39ee741b3`) between that sha and `881fdee59b6f`. Verified from the archive, not from
memory. Do not open a ticket on it.

### 2026-09-16, check-in 0b — `b9bb74d37` landed ONE fix and TWO regressions

**This is the shape to remember from this window**, and Track T's sentence for it is
better than mine: *one of the two regressions was patched within hours in a way that
makes the tree LOOK repaired.* The FPC-bootstrap row going green is exactly the signal
a reader uses to conclude a commit was dealt with — and it would have covered the
second regression for as long as anyone trusted it. Track T caught it by tracing the
bisect WINDOW rather than the headline, and by checking that `64de90285` was purely
forward declarations and therefore could not have fixed the other rows. That last step
is the one a seat skips.

**Root cause, fixed:** `b9bb74d37` added an arm to the bare-identifier branch of
`PyInferExprType` letting an unannotated parameter take its CALL-SITE type. It guarded
two shapes that are not reads of the parameter itself — a following `tkLParen` (a call)
and a preceding `tkDot` (attribute) — and **missed `tkLBrack`.** So `s[0]` typed the
SUBSCRIPT as the container's type instead of the element's, and the character came back
as raw bytes: `first("ab")` printed a space, `last("abc")` printed `P`. Only the
unannotated-parameter shapes broke; the for-loop variant, the container-of-strings and
every annotated shape never enter the arm. Fix: `tkLBrack` joins the other two.

**The verification that actually cost something, and why it was worth it.** The author's
own fixture still passing proves NOTHING on its own — a fixture insensitive to the arm
passes whether or not I reverted him. So I disabled the whole arm, rebuilt, and confirmed
his fixture prints `4607182418800017408`, the exact tell from his commit message. Only
then does "his fixture still passes" mean his fix survived. **Ask what a green is
physically able to observe before quoting it.**

**Attribution trap, twice in one morning in one archive:** `ec4b9c6a1f22` is this seat's
own DOCS-ONLY watch-note commit and was the `bad=` sha for three rows; `3a91d13f1dec` is
a NilPy commit and is the `bad=` for a C test. Both are tested upper bounds named by
POSITION with 1-in-range. Neither is a lead.
