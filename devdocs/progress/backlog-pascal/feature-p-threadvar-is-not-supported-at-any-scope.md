summary: "`threadvar t: LongInt;` at program or unit level is refused with `expected 'begin' before 'threadvar'`. FPC supports it, and it is the language's only spelling for thread-local storage -- so a program that wants per-thread state has no way to ask for it. Measured 2026-09-06 by probe while dispositioning tclass17 and terecs21, two `%FAIL` rows about `threadvar` INSIDE A CLASS whose refusals were being satisfied by this gap rather than by their own subject."

# The measurement

```pascal
program p; {$mode objfpc}
threadvar t: LongInt;
begin t := 1; WriteLn(t); end.
```

```
pascal26: error: expected 'begin' before 'threadvar'
```

# What it costs

`threadvar` is the only source-level spelling of thread-local storage in the
dialect. Anything wanting per-thread state — an error code, a current-context
pointer, a per-thread allocator cache — has to reach for a different mechanism
or not have one. Ranked as a feature rather than a bug because nothing miscompiles;
the declaration is simply not accepted.

Two corpus rows (`tclass17`, `terecs21`) assert that `threadvar` is invalid
INSIDE A CLASS. They pass today, and not for that reason — pxx never gets far
enough to have an opinion about the class. Closing this gap turns them into real
assertions, and they should be re-measured then rather than assumed.
