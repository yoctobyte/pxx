> **Track guessed as C** from the test source. The ranker reads frontmatter, so this line — not the body — decides who works it; correct it if the guess is wrong.

> **This commit CANNOT be the cause.** The job builds only with `$(PXX_STABLE)`, and this commit moved no `stable_linux_amd64/**` — so the bytes that compiled it are unchanged. Look at flakiness or box load, not at the named sha; the bisect is unsound here and has been skipped.

> **origin/master has advanced 32 commit(s) since this sha.** Re-verify at current HEAD before acting — the callback is tagged to the sha that was tested, which may no longer be the state of the tree.

# regression: lib-test#src:tools/crtl_reachability.py red at b26e7ed366f3 (auto-filed by twatch)

- **Type:** regression (auto-filed by Track T watcher, host seven). Untriaged.
- **Found:** 2026-08-29T21:17:12Z
- **Test source:** tools/crtl_reachability.py tools/gen_crtl_map.py +36

## Repro
`tools/testmgr.py --tier full --job 'lib-test#src:tools/crtl_reachability.py'` at b26e7ed366f37d1df21bb8595fc2c0d462db0949

## Range
> **The named sha `b26e7ed366f3` CANNOT be the cause** — it touches no buildable file (docs / tickets / tstate only). It is the sha that was TESTED, i.e. the upper bound of an untested range; the cause is somewhere below it.

bad `b26e7ed366f3`, last good `9beb2af4946c`, **20 observable commit(s)** in range (it builds with `$(PXX_STABLE)`, so `compiler/` commits cannot have caused it and are dropped; pin moves, `lib/` and `test/` are kept) — the watcher narrows this by idle bisect.
