## The observation

Measuring a string-heavy program for the wasm backend, frankwasm found **9 refusals reading
"address of managed string — needs the heap, Phase 6."** The heap landed that morning. The
refusals were true when written, are false now, and nothing in the build can tell the
difference.

> **A refusal is a claim with a date on it.**

Nothing distinguishes a correct refusal from an obsolete one, so an obsolete refusal keeps
working perfectly: it compiles, it is not a test failure, and it silently costs whoever
next measures that surface — the measurement reports mass that no longer exists.

## Not confined to one branch

Grepped on master: **~19 sites** across `ir_codegen386.inc` (5), `ir_codegen_arm32.inc` (3),
`asmfront.inc` (3), `lexer.inc`, `pylexer.inc`, `cparser.inc`, `rparser.inc`, `zparser.inc`,
`pasparser_stmt.inc`, `defs.inc` carry refusals of the form *"not implemented / not
supported … yet"*, several naming a ticket slug.

**Whether any of those is actually stale today is UNMEASURED.** That is step one, and the
ticket must not pretend otherwise — the shape is confirmed repo-wide, the staleness is not.
Same discipline as `bug-a-the-abi-oracle-invariant-is-enforced-by-a-grep-that-cannot-fire`:
find out whether the baseline is non-empty before building anything on it.

## The cheap mechanism, and why the spelling decides it

A refusal citing **"Phase 6"** is not machine-checkable — nothing in the repo knows which
phases have landed. A refusal citing a **ticket slug** is decidable by construction: if the
slug now sits in `devdocs/progress/done/`, the refusal is stale, full stop.

**So the recommendation is a convention change, not a tool**: refusals name the ticket slug
that would remove them, and a ~15-line check (beside `tools/forwardlint.py`) flags any
refusal whose cited slug has been resolved. The check is trivial *given* the convention and
impossible without it, which is the whole content of the ticket.

Adopt the convention on new refusals; retrofit opportunistically rather than as a sweep.

## Priority, honestly

p35. Nothing is broken and no program misbehaves. The cost is **wasted measurement and
misdirected effort** — the failure mode is a lane planning a phase around mass that was
already removed, which is precisely what almost happened here and was caught only because
someone was measuring rather than reading.

frankwasm's position, which is reasonable and is why this is filed rather than assigned:
*"I do not think it wants a mechanism; I think it wants the phase that removes it."* True
for those nine. **The phase removes the instances; it does not remove the generator**, and
every future phase leaves refusals citing a phase that has since landed. Filed so the
generalisation is not lost when the nine disappear.

Fourth face of one generator this week, with
`bug-a-per-cpu-ifdef-chains-in-builtinheap-fail-open`,
`bug-a-the-abi-oracle-invariant-is-enforced-by-a-grep-that-cannot-fire`, and the
vacuous-negative case in `feature-t-audit-tests-that-pass-with-the-implementation-removed`:
**an absent symbol, a silent environment, a grep matching zero, and a refusal that outlived
its cause are all states that are indistinguishable from correctness while carrying no
information.**

**This list is OPEN, and saying so is not a formality.** On the same day these four were
grouped, Track T confirmed a **fifth face** of a *different* four-face family
(`bug-t-a-skipped-job-is-passlike-so-it-becomes-a-false-last-good`) whose parent ticket sits
in `done/` beneath a table headed **"All four faces, closed."** Four were found, four were
fixed, and the ticket said so honestly — and a fifth existed the whole time.

frankT's warning is the one that applies here: **this shape presents one face at a time, and
each one looks like the last.** A closing table asserting an enumeration is complete is
itself a check that cannot fail, which makes it an instance of the very generator it is
summarising. So: no "all N faces" line goes on this family, and a new instance is expected
rather than surprising.
